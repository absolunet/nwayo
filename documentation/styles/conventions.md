# Conventions and useful tips

> We asked our internal developers that use Nwayo daily their tips and tricks and here's the result

## In [Kebab case](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kebab_case) your selector you shall write

## Separate concerns, separates files it will be
This also apply to components.

## Yes, there's still jQuery features ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Even us we need to get over it. 

## Time to go trough the [Nwayo Toolbox](TODO) you will invest.
There's a bunch of mixins and other stuff available. Why do it again? Ain't nobody got time for that!

## `nwayo watch` is a horse wearing blinders🏇🏻
When we do some modifications to yaml files (include new stuff or change konstan), you need to stop and restart the `nwayo watch`. Otherwise, changes won't be take into consideration. 

## If you don't know how to say Nwayo, try `nwayo --pronounce`
It's always easier to now how to pronouns what you're talking about

## Properly your development tools you shall set
Exemple, automatically order css value so that the linters don't scream at you for the same things all the time 😱
