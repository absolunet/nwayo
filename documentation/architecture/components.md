# Components
> A component is composer by different type of content that is included in one of many bundle. A general component can be created and imported in other to make sure there's no duplicate content and reuse what has already put in place.

## Path
The source files are located under `[NWAYO_ROOT]/components/[NAME]`. The component must also be included in one or many bundle.

## Types
They are 3 types content that is included in a component:
- [Assets](../assets/readme.md)
- [Scripts](../scripts/readme.md)
- [Styles](../styles/readme.md)

## Good practices
- One purpose by component

## Tasks
Almost all the tasks will interact with a component
