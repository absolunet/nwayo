## About Node IoC

> **NOTE**: This is the Node IoC extension scaffold repository. If you want to build an application, please visit the [main application repository](https://github.com/absolunet/node-ioc-app).

Node IoC is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) framework designed to help developers create elegant and well-designed applications, for both the Web and the CLI. Based on _[SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)_ principles, it comes out with a lot of features that removes the pain of crafting new applications:

 - Simple, yet powerful, [dependency injection container](https://documentation.absolunet.com/docs-node-ioc/en/1.0/architecture/container)
 - Complete [CLI command system](https://documentation.absolunet.com/docs-node-ioc/en/1.0/basics/commands) powered by [Yargs](http://yargs.js.org/)
 - Full [routing and HTTP handling](https://documentation.absolunet.com/docs-node-ioc/en/1.0/basics/routing) powered by [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
 - [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/) [database connections](https://documentation.absolunet.com/docs-node-ioc/en/1.0/handling-data/database) with [Bookshelf ORM](https://bookshelfjs.org/)
 - [Cache system with multiple back-ends](https://documentation.absolunet.com/docs-node-ioc/en/1.0/going-deeper/caching)  
 - [Configuration over code approach](https://documentation.absolunet.com/docs-node-ioc/en/1.0/basics/config)
 - Multiple 3rd-party integrations such as [PubSubJS](https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS), [joi](https://hapi.dev/family/joi/), [JsRender](https://www.jsviews.com/) and much more
 - [Modular structure with simple integration](https://documentation.absolunet.com/docs-node-ioc/en/1.0/architecture/service-provider)
 - Complete and powerful [Jest integration for testing](https://documentation.absolunet.com/docs-node-ioc/en/1.0/going-deeper/test) with a class-based approach, like [PHPUnit (PHP)](https://phpunit.de/) or [NUnit (C#)](https://nunit.org/)

Node IoC was mostly inspired by Laravel and Symfony for the structure, as well by Angular.js for the dependency injection approach. The key that makes Node IoC a better platform to start with is that it is based on all the best things that have been made in JavaScript so far: it unifies the most popular tools and makes implementing them under a complex application feel like a breeze.


## Learning Node IoC

The simplest way to learn Node IoC is through the [official documentation](https://documentation.absolunet.com/docs-node-ioc). You can easily get started with the early chapters that give you the step-by-step approach to install the application and to implement basic features. However, if you want to go deeper, the documentation covers all key features, or you can read the [API documentation](https://documentation.absolunet.com/docs-node-ioc/api).
