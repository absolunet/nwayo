## What we are looking for _(Spoiler alert: ANYTHING)_

We love to receive contributions from the community! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation or the tests, submitting bug reports and feature requests or simply writing code.

**Please, before investing a lot of time, check with us if it's something we're interested in, just so we don't have to reject something you worked hard on...**


## How to submit a contribution

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Please **do not change anything** pertaining to the versioning *(We'll take care of that)*.
    * Please **do not update** any dependencies not pertaining to your changes *(We'll take care of that)*.
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Be sure you have adjusted the tests accordingly.
    * Be sure you have adjusted the documentation accordingly.
