## JsRender: best-of-breed templating
_Simple and intuitive, powerful and extensible, lightning fast_<br/>

**JsRender** is a light-weight but powerful templating engine, highly extensible, and optimized for high-performance pure string-based rendering, without DOM or jQuery dependency.

**JSRender** and **JsViews** together provide the next-generation implementation of both _JQuery Templates_, and _JQuery Data Link_ - and supersede those libraries.

<h3>Documentation and Downloads</h3>
**[Documentation](http://jsviews.com)**, **[downloads](http://jsviews.com/#download)**, **[samples](http://jsviews.com/#samples)** and **[API docs and tutorials](http://jsviews.com/#jsrapi)** are available on the **[jsviews.com website](http://jsviews.com/#jsrender)**.

<h3>JsRender and JsViews</h3>
JsRender is used for rendering of templates to strings, ready for insertion in the DOM.<br/>
It is also used by the [JsViews](http://jsviews.com/#jsviews) platform, which adds data binding to JsRender templates,
and provides a fully-fledged MVVM platform for easily creating interactive data-driven single page apps and websites.
